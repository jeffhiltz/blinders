# Blinders

I wanted to try making some blinders to attach to my glasses.  I have a bright window to my side when I'm working.  It's great to have the light, but I find it easier to focus on my monitor if I block the light coming into my peripheral vision.

Getting the size of the clip correct was tricky, so I put in an option to print only that section of the blinder.  This way you're able to quickly print a couple sizes to find the right fit.

I found that printing them standing up worked well.  My printer doesn't print well without a base, so this way I was able to have a small base.  Also it's easier to remove supports that are between the clip and the base than between the clip and the shield.
